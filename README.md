Bachelor Project

With this Shiny application it is possible to explore conserved phosphosites of some protein groups. The project is still in prgress, so more functios and features will be added. For now you can display the Multiple Sequence Alignments of Group 1 to Group 1096.
There is a search function to find your favourite Protein! WOW;)  (if it is there)
And you see how many phosphorylated positions a Group has. Several filter options are added to find the most interesting groups. Give it some time to react, especially when using the search function.

Just download the Shiny_App_Phosphosites Markdown file and launch it, e.g. in RStudio.
