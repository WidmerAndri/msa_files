MSA files of my Bachelorthesis. 

With this Shiny application it is possible to explore conserved phosphosites of some protein groups. The project is still in prgress, so it is not complete and more data will be available at some point. For now you can display the Multiple Sequence Alignments of Group 1, 2, 3 and 13. 

Just download the Shiny_App_Phosphosites Markdown file and launch it, e.g. in RStudio.
