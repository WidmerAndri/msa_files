Bachelor Project

With this Shiny application it is possible to explore conserved phosphosites of some protein groups. The project is still in prgress, so more functios and features will be added. For now you can display the Multiple Sequence Alignments of Group 1 to Group 1000. In theory there are 1096, but there are probably limits in the Dropdown of Shiny or something.
There is a search function to find your favourite Protein! WOW;)  (if it is there)
And you see how many phosphorylated positions a Group has.

Just download the Shiny_App_Phosphosites Markdown file and launch it, e.g. in RStudio.
