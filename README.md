Bachelor Project

With this Shiny application it is possible to explore conserved phosphosites of some protein groups. The project is still in prgress, so more functios and features will potentially be added. For now you can display the Multiple Sequence Alignments of 1096 groups. There is some data overlap. But don't worry this is because in Yeast several genes are duplicated. The different databases used different ways to store and display the data. So for example OMA has stored it according to the position of a gene within the genome (duplication can be found twice) and UniProt has for two same gene products only one entry. That is why some groups appear twice and are identical. There is a search function to find your favourite Protein! WOW;) (if it is there) And you see how many phosphorylated positions each alignment has. Several filter options are added to find the most interesting groups. Give it some time to react, especially when using the search function.

Just download the Shiny_App_Phosphosites Markdown file and launch it, e.g. in RStudio.
